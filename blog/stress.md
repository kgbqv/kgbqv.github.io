ok so

i'm about to take fuckin finals.

lemme tell you man, the stress is fuckin real

i've been drowning in the damn deadlines, assignments, all that stuff.

and when i'm stressed, i tend to get a lil....*weird*.

i decided to do something that would probably make no sense to anyone else but felt like the best decision in the moment: i started a website.

yep. a whole fuckin website.

you’d think i’d be spending every second studying for finals, but nope, i went ahead and got distracted. it started as a weird way to escape, honestly. i was just so overwhelmed that the thought of sitting there and doing nothing wasn’t an option. so, i decided to be productive. had no idea what it'd turn into, but the process is what matters, right?

it was definitely a rollercoaster. FAQ was “why am i even doing this?” but then i’d be like "whatever", made some shit worked and it’d feel like the best thing ever. that little bit of success was enough to keep me going.

and you know what? i’ve learned a lot through all this. not just about building websites (though that’s been pretty fun) but about how i deal with stress. sometimes you just gotta throw yourself into something else. sometimes, the best way to deal with stress is to stop thinking about it and start doing something else.

so yeah, finals are still coming. it's in like 8 hours from now actually. and the stress isn’t going anywhere. but now, i’ve got a website that’s a reminder of how i turned that pressure into something... i don’t know, cool? maybe. but i’m proud of it, and that’s all that matters.

if you're stressed out like me, maybe find something to pour your energy into, even if it’s darn random. might be surprising.

khgb, on a god damned bed trying to study in a noisy dorm.

thanks for reading.
